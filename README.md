# FEM_2D

The above implementations for CST and quad elements are simple exercises to test the FEM in simple elasticity problems (e.g., elastic beams, cantilevers, etc). These subroutines have not been reviewed or debugged and are still under development. Furthermore, they are presented without any warranty and are intended only for academic purposes.
